# How to develop these pages using Jekyll

1. Set up conda enviroment using `environment.yml`. Note that this environment may have more than is necessary -- it is the environment I am working with rather than a minimal install.
2. Install jekyll
   `gem install bundler jekyll`
3. install the github pages themes/plugins
   `gem install github-pages`
4. launch the jekyll web server
   `bundle exec jekyll server`

Due to our set up you'll need to navigate to the web server (usually https://localhost:4000) and then click on the docs link.
